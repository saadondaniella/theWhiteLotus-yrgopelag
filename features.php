    <div class="features-text">
        <p>On Cozea Island, not everything reveals itself at once. Some things are meant to be discovered.</p>

        <p>
            Hidden across the island you’ll find a growing collection of features —
            from laid-back games by the sea to experiences that might keep you awake at night.
        </p>

        <p>Feeling a little, ehm.. economical? We’ve got a wheel for that.</p>

        <p>But Cozea Island is not about choosing from a list. It’s about curiosity.</p>

        <p>

            Tip: write the feature name + dates (Jan 2026) — we may be able to arrange it.
